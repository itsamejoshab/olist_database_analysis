![entity_olist](olist_entity.svg)

### **About**

*`Olist` is Brazil's largest department store connecting small businesses from all over Brazil.
The data includes 100K orders from the period between Oct-2016 to Oct-2018. The database includes information
about orders associated with customers sellers their payment methods products and locations.*

*The dataset is available at Kaggle on this [link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/olistbr/brazilian-ecommerce?select=product_category_name_translation.csv)*

*In this project, first we construct database from scratch then we perform an in-depth `analysis` of customer sellers and their orders and gain some critical `insights`
about the orders volume, delivery time, valuable customer markets, important sellers by revenue, etc using `PostgreSQL` and `RQL` (a python SQL generator)*

*We perform analysis on four major categories of data provided by Olist*
